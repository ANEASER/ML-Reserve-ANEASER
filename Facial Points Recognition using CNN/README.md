# Facial Points Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

The IPYNB file includes the code for the same and each cell processing has been explained as a comment before it to increase user understandability.

Due to large size of dataset, I have uploaded it on Google drive.

Link for the Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14CfNI83kNAaceFbSNyov9Fm5VXFxmMF9?usp=sharing
